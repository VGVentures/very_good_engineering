# Contributing

Thank you for taking the time to contribute! ðŸ¥³

We follow the code of conduct outlined by the [Contributor Covenant][covenant].

This is a front-end [AstroJS] project that uses [MDX] for documentation. If you're not a professional front-end web developer, don't worry â€”Â you can usually just create a new document in `src/content/docs` and look at nearby docs to see how to format your content.

You will need to setup [NodeJS]. We recommend using something like [NVM] to manage node versions. Once you have a node environment setup, you can run `npm run dev` to start the local development server so you can see the changes in the site.
