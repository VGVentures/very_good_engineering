At Very Good Ventures, our goal is to achieve 100% test coverage on all projects. Writing tests not only helps to reduce the number of bugs, but also encourages code to be written in a very clean, consistent, and maintainable way. While testing can initially add some additional time to the project, the trade-off is fewer bugs, higher confidence when shipping, and less time spent in QA cycles.

## Organize test files

Test files should be organized to match your project file structure.

This `my_package` library contains `models` and `widgets`. The `test` folder should copy this structure:

<FileTree>

- my_package/
  - lib/
    - models/
      - model_a.dart
      - model_b.dart
      - models.dart
    - widgets/
      - widget_1.dart
      - widget_2.dart
      - widgets.dart
  - test/
    ...

</FileTree>

<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="Good ✅">
    <FileTree>

        - test/
          - models/
            - model_a_test.dart
            - model_b_test.dart
          - widgets/
            - widget_1_test.dart
            - widget_2_test.dart

    </FileTree>

  </TabItem>

  <TabItem label="Bad ❗️">
    <FileTree>

      - test/
        - model_a_test.dart
        - model_b_test.dart
        - widgets_test.dart

    </FileTree>

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

> Note: `models.dart` and `widgets.dart` are barrel files and do not need to be tested.

:::tip
You can automatically create or find a test file when using the [Flutter VS Code Extension](https://docs.flutter.dev/tools/vs-code) by right-clicking on the file within the [explorer view](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/getstarted/userinterface#_explorer-view) and selecting "Go to Tests" or using the ["Go to Test/Implementation File"](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/blob/09cb9828b7b315d667ee5dc97e9287a6c6c8655a/package.json#L323) command within the [command palette](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/getstarted/userinterface#_command-palette).

## Assert test results using expect or verify

All tests should have one or more statements at the end of the test asserting the test result using either an [expect](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/flutter_test/expect.html) or [verify](https://pub.dev/documentation/mocktail/latest/).

<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="Good ✅">
    ```dart
    testWidgets('calls [onTap] on tapping widget', (tester) async {
      var isTapped = false;
      await tester.pumpWidget(SomeTappableWidget({
              onTap: isTapped = true,
            }
          ),
        );
      await tester.pumpAndSettle();

      await tester.tap(SomeTappableWidget());
      await tester.pumpAndSettle();

      expect(isTapped, isTrue);
    });
    ```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="Bad ❗️">
    ```dart
    testWidgets('can tap widget', (tester) async {
      await tester.pumpWidget(SomeTappableWidget());
      await tester.pumpAndSettle();

      await tester.tap(SomeTappableWidget());
      await tester.pumpAndSettle();
    });
    ```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

The above test would pass coverage on `SomeTappableWidget`, and pass as long as no exception is thrown, but it doesn't really tell any valuable information about what the widget should do.

Now, we are explicitly testing that we have accessed the `onTap` property of `SomeTappableWidget`, which makes this test more valuable, because its behavior is also tested.

## Use matchers and expectations

[Matchers](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/package-matcher_matcher/package-matcher_matcher-library.html) provides better messages in tests and should always be used in [expectations](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/flutter_test/expect.html).

<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="Good ✅">
    ```dart
    expect(name, equals('Hank'));
    expect(people, hasLength(3));
    expect(valid, isTrue);
    ```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="Bad ❗️">
    ```dart
    expect(name, 'Hank');
    expect(people.length, 3);
    expect(valid, true);
    ```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Use string expression with types

If you're referencing a type within a test description, use a [string expression](https://dart.dev/language/built-in-types#string) to ease renaming the type:

<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="Good ✅">
    ```dart
    testWidgets('renders $YourView', (tester) async {});
    ```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="Bad ❗️">
    ```dart
    testWidgets('renders YourView', (tester) async {});
    ```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

If your [test](https://pub.dev/documentation/test/latest/test/test.html) or [group](https://pub.dev/documentation/test/latest/test/group.html) description only contains a type, consider omitting the string expression:

<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="Good ✅">
    ```dart
    group(YourView, () {});
    ```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="Bad ❗️">
    ```dart
    group('$YourView', () {});
    ```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Descriptive test

Don't be afraid of being verbose in your tests. Make sure everything is readable, which can make it easier to maintain over time.

<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="Good ✅">
    ```dart
    testWidgets('renders $YourView', (tester) async {});
    testWidgets('renders $YourView for $YourState', (tester) async {});
    test('given an [input] is returning the [output] expected', () async {});
    blocTest<YourBloc, RecipeGeneratorState>('emits $StateA if ...',);
    ```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="Bad ❗️">
    ```dart
    testWidgets('renders', (tester) async {});
    test('works', () async {});
    blocTest<YourBloc, RecipeGeneratorState>('emits',);
    ```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Test with a single purpose

Aim to test one scenario per test. You might end up with more tests in the codebase, but this is preferred over creating one single test to cover several cases. This helps with readability and debugging failing tests.

<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="Good ✅">
    ```dart
    testWidgets('renders $WidgetA', (tester) async {});
    testWidgets('renders $WidgetB', (tester) async {});
    ```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="Bad ❗️">
    ```dart
    testWidgets('renders $WidgetA and $WidgetB', (tester) async {});
    ```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Use keys carefully

Although keys can be an easy way to look for a widget while testing, they tend to be harder to maintain, especially if we use hard-coded keys. Instead, we recommend finding a widget by its type.

<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="Good ✅">
    ```dart
    expect(find.byType(HomePage), findsOneWidget);
    ```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="Bad ❗️">
    ```dart
    expect(find.byKey(Key('homePageKey')), findsOneWidget);
    ```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Use private mocks

Developers may reuse mocks across different test files. This could lead to undesired behaviors in tests. For example, if you change the default values of a mock in one class, it could effect your test results in another. In order to avoid this, it is better to create private mocks for each test file.

<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="Good ✅">
    ```dart
    class _MockYourClass extends Mock implements YourClass {}
    ```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="Bad ❗️">
    ```dart
    class MockYourClass extends Mock implements YourClass {}
    ```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

:::tip
The analyzer will warn you about unused private mocks (but not if they're public!) if the [`unused_element` diagnostic message](https://dart.dev/tools/diagnostic-messages?utm_source=dartdev&utm_medium=redir&utm_id=diagcode&utm_content=unused_element#unused_element) is not suppressed.
:::

:::tip
If you have the [Bloc VS Code extension](https://github.com/felangel/bloc/tree/master/extensions/vscode) installed, you can use the [`_mock` snippet](https://github.com/felangel/bloc/tree/master/extensions/vscode#bloc) to quickly create a private mock.

## Split your tests by groups

Having multiple tests in a class could cause problems with readability. It is better to split your tests into groups:

- Widget tests: you could potentially group by "renders", "navigation", etc.
- Bloc tests: group by the name of the event.
- Repositories and clients: group by name of the method you are testing.

> Tip: If your test file starts to become unreadable or unmanageable, consider splitting the file
> that you are testing into smaller files.

## Keep test setup inside a group

When running tests through the `very_good` CLI's optimization, all test files become a single file.

If test setup methods are outside of a group, those setups may cause side effects and make tests fail due to issues that wouldn't happen when running without the optimization.

In order to avoid such issues, refrain from adding `setUp` and `setUpAll` (as well as `tearDown` and `tearDownAll`) methods outside a group:

<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="Good ✅">
    ```dart
    void main() {
      group(UserRepository, () {
        late ApiClient apiClient;

        setUp(() {
          apiClient = _MockApiClient();
          // mock api client methods...
        });

        // Tests...
      });
    }
    ```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="Bad ❗️">
    ```dart
    void main() {
      late ApiClient apiClient;

      setUp(() {
        apiClient = _MockApiClient();
        // mock api client methods...
      });

      group(UserRepository, () {
        // Tests...
      });
    }
    ```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Shared mutable objects should be initialized per test

We should ensure that shared mutable objects are initialized per test. This avoids the possibility of tests affecting each other, which can lead to flaky tests due to unexpected failures during test parallelization or random ordering.

<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="Good ✅">
    ```dart
    void main() {
      group(_MySubject, () {
        late _MySubjectDependency myDependency;

        setUp(() {
          myDependency = _MySubjectDependency();
        });

        test('value starts at 0', () {
          // This test no longer assumes the order tests are run.
          final subject = _MySubject(myDependency);
          expect(subject.value, equals(0));
        });

        test('value can be increased', () {
          final subject = _MySubject(myDependency);

          subject.increase();

          expect(subject.value, equals(1));
        });
      });
    }
    ```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="Bad ❗️">
    ```dart
    class _MySubjectDependency {
      var value = 0;
    }

    class _MySubject {
      // Although the constructor is constant, it is mutable.
      const _MySubject(this._dependency);

      final _MySubjectDependency _dependency;

      get value => _dependency.value;

      void increase() => _dependency.value++;
    }

    void main() {
      group(_MySubject, () {
        final _MySubjectDependency myDependency = _MySubjectDependency();

        test('value starts at 0', () {
          // This test assumes the order tests are run.
          final subject = _MySubject(myDependency);
          expect(subject.value, equals(0));
        });

        test('value can be increased', () {
          final subject = _MySubject(myDependency);

          subject.increase();

          expect(subject.value, equals(1));
        });
      });
    }
    ```

## Avoid using magic strings to tag tests

When [tagging tests](https://github.com/dart-lang/test/blob/master/pkgs/test/doc/configuration.md#configuring-tags), avoid using magic strings. Instead, use constants to tag tests. This helps to avoid typos and makes it easier to refactor.

      },

:::caution

[Dart 2.17](https://dart.dev/guides/whats-new#may-11-2022-2-17-release) introduced [enhanced enumerations](https://dart.dev/language/enums)
and [Dart 3.3](https://dart.dev/guides/whats-new#february-15-2024-3-3-release) introduced [extension types](https://dart.dev/language/extension-types). These could be used to declare the tags within arguments, however you will not be able to use the tags within the [`@Tags` annotation](https://pub.dev/documentation/test/latest/test/Tags-class.html).

Instead, define an abstract class to hold your tags:

```dart
/// Defined tags for tests.
///
/// Use these tags to group tests and run them separately.
///
/// Tags are defined within the `dart_test.yaml` file.
///
/// See also:
///
/// * [Dart Test Configuration documentation](https://github.com/dart-lang/test/blob/master/pkgs/test/doc/configuration.md)
abstract class TestTag {
  /// Tests that compare golden files.
  static const golden = 'golden';
}
```

## Do not share state between tests

Tests should not share state between them to ensure they remain independent, reliable, and predictable.

When tests share state (such as relying on static members), the order that tests are executed in can cause inconsistent results. Implicitly sharing state between tests means that tests no longer exist in isolation and are influenced by each other. As a result, it can be difficult to identify the root cause of test failures.

      int value = 0;
      void increment() => value++;

      group(_Counter, () {
        late _Counter counter;

        setUp(() => counter = _Counter());

        test('increment', () {
          counter.increment();
          expect(counter.value, 1);
        });

        test('decrement', () {
          counter.decrement();
          expect(counter.value, -1);

        });

        test('decrement', () {
          counter.decrement();
          // The expectation only succeeds when the previous test executes first.
          expect(counter.value, 0);
        });
      });
    }
    ```

## Use random test ordering

Running tests in an arbitrary (random) order is a crucial practice to identify and eliminate flaky tests, specially during continuous integration.

Flaky tests are those that pass or fail inconsistently without changes to the codebase, often due to unintended dependencies between tests.

By running tests in random order, these hidden dependencies are more likely to be exposed, as any reliance on the order of test execution becomes clear when tests fail unexpectedly.

This practice ensures that tests do not share state or rely on the side effects of previous tests, leading to a more robust and reliable test suite. Overall, the tests become easier to trust and reduce debugging time caused by intermittent test failures.
