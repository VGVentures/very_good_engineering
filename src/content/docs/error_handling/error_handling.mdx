## Document when a call may throw

Document exceptions associated with calling a function in its documentation comments to help understand when an exception might be thrown.

Properly documenting possible exceptions allows developers to handle exceptions, leading to more robust and error-resistant code and reducing the likelihood of unintended errors.

    ```dart
    /// Permanently deletes an account with the given [name].

    /// Throws:
    ///
    /// * [UnauthorizedException] if the active role is not [Role.admin], since only
    ///  admins are authorized to delete accounts.
    void deleteAccount(String name) {
      if (activeRole != Role.admin) {
        throw UnauthorizedException('Only admin can delete account');
      }
      // ...
    }
    ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="Bad ❗️">
    ```dart
    /// Permanently deletes an account with the given [name].
    void deleteAccount(String name) {
      if (activeRole != Role.admin) {
        throw UnauthorizedException('Only admin can delete account');
      }
      // ...
    }
    ```

## Define descriptive exceptions

Implement `Exception` with descriptive names rather than simply throwing a generic `Exception`.

By creating custom exceptions, developers can provide more meaningful error messages and handle different error types in a more granular way. This enhances code readability and maintainability, as it becomes clear what type of error is being dealt with.

    ```dart
    class UnauthorizedException implements Exception {
      UnauthorizedException(this.message);

      final String message;

      @override
      String toString() => 'UnauthorizedException: $message';
    }

    void deleteAccount(String name) {
      if (activeRole != Role.admin) {
        throw UnauthorizedException('Only admin can delete account');
      }
      // ...
    }

    void main() {
      try {
        deleteAccount('user');
      } on UnauthorizedException catch (e) {
        // Handle the exception.
      }
    }
    ```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="Bad ❗️">
    ```dart
    void deleteAccount(String name) {
      if (activeRole != Role.admin) {
        throw Exception('Only admin can delete account');
      }
      // ...
    }

    void main() {
      try {
        deleteAccount('user');
      } on Exception catch (e) {
        // Exception is a marker interface implemented by all core library exceptions.
        // It is very generic, potentially catching many different types of exceptions,
        // lacking intent, and making the code harder to understand.
      }
    }
    ```
