## Setup

We welcome (and encourage) contributions to Very Good Engineering!

Since this is an [Astro] static website with the [Starlight] theme, you'll need to make sure you've installed [NVM] and the latest stable version of [Node.js].

### GitHub PAT

At build time, we dynamically fetch information about GitHub repositories so our cards on the home page are rendered with up-to-date information about the repositories they are linking to. To avoid being throttled by GitHub on rebuilds, you may wish to [create a GitHub PAT][github-pat] with permission to read public repositories and add it to your environment variable in your `.zshrc` or `.bashrc` file:

```
export VGVENTURES_GITHUB_PAT="(your github pat string)"
```

## Contributions

Once you've made changes, you'll want to lint and format your code before submitting a pull request:

```bash title="Terminal"
npm run lint
npm run format
```

:::note
For substantial content changes or additions, we encourage you to first file an [issue] or raise a [discussion] so that we can consider the proposed changes.

For small grammatical or typographical errors, feel free to submit a pull request directly.
