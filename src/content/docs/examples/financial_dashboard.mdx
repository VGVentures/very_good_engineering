The Financial Dashboard simulates a budgeting app with mocked data that showcases different themes, interactive graphs and UI animations when updating the data.

## Architecture

The Financial Dashboard is a simple demo managed by two state handlers, a Flavor Cubit to control which theme is shown, and a Financial Data Bloc that is responsible for generating random financial data. We will take a look into how both work together to update the theme and the data.

### Theming

The theme in the app consists of a new color pallete and a different widget layout. With this in mind, we cannot just update the `ThemeData` in the `MaterialApp` widget, but we handle the feature with a `FlavorCubit`.

It is a simple cubit that emits the selected flavor when the corresponding button is tapped.

```dart
class FlavorCubit extends Cubit<AppFlavor> {
  FlavorCubit() : super(AppFlavor.one);

  void select(AppFlavor flavor) => emit(flavor);
}
```

And rebuilds the appropriate page with a `BlocBuilder`.

```dart
BlocBuilder<FlavorCubit, AppFlavor>(
  builder: (context, state) {
    return switch (state) {
      AppFlavor.one => DeviceFrame(
          lightTheme: const FlavorOneTheme().themeData,
          darkTheme: const FlavorOneDarkTheme().themeData,
          child: const AppOne(),
        ),
      AppFlavor.two => DeviceFrame(
          lightTheme: const FlavorTwoTheme().themeData,
          darkTheme: const FlavorTwoDarkTheme().themeData,
          child: const AppTwo(),
        ),
      AppFlavor.three => DeviceFrame(
          lightTheme: const FlavorThreeTheme().themeData,
          darkTheme: const FlavorThreeDarkTheme().themeData,
          child: const AppThree(),
        ),
    };
  },
)
```

### Financial Data

The example data in the app is randomized on launch and every time the user pulls to refresh. This is handled by a `FinancialDataBloc` that creates random data with a set of constraints.

In addition, when generating new data, the text and the graphs are animated.

<Image
  src={dataRefreshing}
  alt="Financial data being refreshed. The numbers count up from 0 to its value."
  width="500"
/>

To achieve this, we divided each piece of data in a different widget so it can be reused. For each widget that needs animation, we defined both a controller and an animation. To make the first animation when the widget is loaded, we set the controller and run it in the `initState`.

```dart
  late AnimationController _controller;
  late Animation<double> _animation;

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();

    _controller = AnimationController(
      duration: const Duration(seconds: 1),
      vsync: this,
    );

    final state = context.read<FinancialDataBloc>().state;
    _animation = Tween<double>(begin: 0, end: state.currentSavings).animate(
      _controller,
    );
    _controller.forward();
  }
```

But that wouldn't be sufficient if we also want to animate the data when the user pulls to refresh. To power that feature, we used a `BlocListener` that waits for a change in the corresponding data to reset and run the animation controller again.

```dart
BlocListener<FinancialDataBloc, FinancialDataState>(
  listenWhen: (previous, current) =>
      previous.currentSavings != current.currentSavings,
  listener: (context, state) {
    _animation = Tween<double>(begin: 0, end: state.currentSavings).animate(
      _controller,
    );
    _controller
      ..reset()
      ..forward();
  },
  child: ...,
)
```
