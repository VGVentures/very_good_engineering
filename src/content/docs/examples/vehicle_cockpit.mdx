The Vehicle Cockpit simulates a realtime speedometer and tachometer as the user accelerates around the track.

## Flame

[Flame](https://pub.dev/packages/flame) is a game engine that is built for Flutter. It is used to render and update our gauge. Let's take a deeper look into how the components that make up the gauge are created and composed together to form a working speedometer and tachometer.

### GaugeGame

The `GaugeGame` is the [`FlameGame`](https://docs.flame-engine.org/latest/flame/game.html) object. All of the components that make up the gauge are added inside of the `onLoad` method. These components include the [GaugeComponent](#gaugecomponent), [Speedometer](#speedometer), and the [Gear](#gear).

```dart
  @override
  Future<void> onLoad() async {
    await add(
      gauge = GaugeComponent(
        size: Vector2.all(340),
        position: size / 2,
        maxRpm: (sim.vehicle.engineRpmMaximum / 1000).round(),
        dangerZone: (sim.vehicle.engineRpmRedline / 1000).round(),
        appTheme: appTheme,
      ),
    );

    await add(
      speedometer = Speedometer(
        speed: 0,
        position: size / 2 - Vector2(0, 40),
      ),
    );

    await add(
      gear = Gear(
        position: size / 2 + Vector2(0, 30),
        triangleSize: 60,
      ),
    );
  }
```

Not only does the `GaugeGame` add the components to be displayed, it also handles the user input to update the game. As you'll see below, the `GaugeGame` can directly call methods on its components, and can also make its variables and methods available to its children.

The `GaugeGame` relies on a [`GameLoop`](https://docs.flame-engine.org/latest/flame/game.html#game-loop) to update the components on the screen. This calls the `update` method where we can update the gauge's progress, speedometer, and current gear.

```dart
  @override
  void update(double dt) {
    sim.simulate(dt * timeScale, hittingGas ? 1.0 : -1.3);

    gauge.setProgress(
      sim.engineRpm / sim.vehicle.engineRpmMaximum,
      dt,
    );
    speedometer.speed = sim.speed;
    gear.gearText.text = sim.gear.toString();

    onSpeedChanged(sim.speed);

    super.update(dt);
  }
```

#### GaugeComponent

The `GaugeComponent` is a [`PositionComponent`](https://docs.flame-engine.org/latest/other_modules/oxygen/components.html#positioncomponent) that composes `GaugeRing` and the components that are needed to display the vehicle's RPM information: `GaugeProgress` and `GaugeRpmNumbers`. These are added in the `GaugeComponent`'s `onLoad` method:

```dart
  @override
  Future<void> onLoad() async {
    await add(
      GaugeRing(
        size: size.clone(),
        color: appTheme.colorScheme.error,
      ),
    );

    const offset = 16.0;
    final innerRingPosition = Vector2.all(offset / 2);
    final innerRingSize = size.clone() - Vector2.all(offset);
    await add(
      GaugeProgress(
        position: innerRingPosition,
        size: innerRingSize,
      ),
    );
    await add(
      GaugeRpmNumbers(
        position: innerRingPosition,
        size: innerRingSize,
      ),
    );
  }
```

##### Gauge Ring

The `GaugeRing` is a `PositionComponent` that forms the outline of the gauge. This component simply renders the ring.

<Image src={gaugeRing} alt="The outer ring of the gauge." height="200" />

##### Gauge Progress

The `GaugeProgress` is another `PositionComponent` object that draws the gradient RPM progress bar that is located just inside of the `GaugeRing`. The `GaugeComponent`'s `progress` value gets set within the `GaugeGame`'s `update` method. The `GaugeProgress` object makes use of the [`ParentIsA`](https://docs.flame-engine.org/latest/flame/components.html#ensuring-a-component-has-a-given-parent) [mixin](https://dart.dev/language/mixins), which gives the component access to the parent component via the `parent` property.

<Image src={gaugeProgress} alt="The vehicle's current RPM." height="200" />

##### Gauge RPM Numbers

The `GaugeRpmNumbers` is the last `PositionComponent` object that is used for the tachometer. This component consist of the `GaugeRmpPoint` component, that draws the RPM tick marks, and also the `GaugeNumberIndicator` that draws the RPM numbers below the ticks.

  src={gaugeRpmNumbers}
  alt="The RPM ticks and numbers within the gauge."

/>

### Speedometer

The `Speedometer` is a [`TextComponent`](https://docs.flame-engine.org/latest/flame/rendering/text_rendering.html#textcomponent) object that renders the current speed and the "MPH" label to the screen. The `Speedometer` object uses the [`HasGameRef<GaugeGame>`](https://github.com/flame-engine/flame/blob/a5338d0c20d01bbe461c6d7fed5951d11e1c76f0/packages/flame/lib/src/components/mixins/has_game_ref.dart) mixin, which allows it to access variables and methods that are in the `GaugeGame` class. This makes it easier for the `Speedometer` to access the `GaugeGame`'s `appTheme` and `l10n` members.

<Image src={speedometer} alt="The vehicle's current speed." height="200" />

### Gear

The `Gear` is a `PositionComponent` that renders the vehicle's current gear inside of a triangle. The `gearText` is set directly in the `GaugeGame`.

```dart
gear.gearText.text = sim.gear.toString();
```

<Image src={gear} alt="The vehicle's current gear." height="200" />

## Adding the Gauge to the Widget Tree

To add the gauge to the `DashboardPage`, we'll use Flame's [`GameWidget`](https://docs.flame-engine.org/latest/flame/game_widget.html). The `GameWidget` requires a `Game` object. In this case, that would be our `GaugeGame`.

```dart
final game = GaugeGame(
  sim: VehicleSim(vehicle: Vehicles.compactCrossoverSUV),
  appTheme: theme,
  l10n: l10n,
  onSpeedChanged: onSpeedChanged,
);

// ...

LayoutBuilder(
  builder: (context, constraints) {
    final width = min<double>(400, constraints.maxWidth);
    return SizedBox.square(
      dimension: width * .75,
      child: Transform.scale(
        scale: width / 500,
        child: GameWidget(
          game: game,
        ),
      ),
    );
  },
),
```

The `acceleratorPedalPushed()` and `acceleratorPedalReleased()` can be called on the `game` object to simulate pressing and releasing the accelerator pedal.
