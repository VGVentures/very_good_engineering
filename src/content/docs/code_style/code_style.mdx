In general, the best guides for code style are the [Effective Dart](https://dart.dev/effective-dart) guidelines and the linter rules set up in [very_good_analysis](https://pub.dev/packages/very_good_analysis). However, there are certain practices we've learned outside of these two places that will make code more maintainable.

## Record Types

Among other things, the release of Dart 3.0 introduced [record types](https://dart.dev/language/records), a way to store two different but related pieces of data without creating a separate data class. When using record types, be sure to choose expressive names for positional values.

<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="Bad ❗️">
    ```dart
    Future<(String, String)> getUserNameAndEmail() async => _someApiFetchMethod();

    final userData = await getUserNameAndEmail();

    // a bunch of other code...

    if (userData.$1.isValid) {
      // do stuff
    }
    ```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

The above example will compile, but it is not immediately obvious what value `userData.$1` refers to here. The name of the function gives the reader the impression that the second value in the record is the email, but it is not clear. Particularly in a large codebase, where there could be more processing in between the call to `getUserNameAndEmail()` and the check on `userData.$1`, reviewers will not be able to tell immediately what is going on here.

<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="Good ✅">
    ```dart
    Future<(String, String)> getUserNameAndEmail() async => _someApiFetchMethod();

    final (username, email) = await getUserNameAndEmail();

    // a bunch of other code...

    if (email.isValid) {
      // do stuff
    }
    ```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

Now, we are expressly naming the values that we are getting from our record type. Any reviewer or future maintainer of this code will know what value is being validated.

:::tip
While this is our recommended practice for dealing with record types, you might want to consider whether you actually need a record type. Particularly in larger projects where you are using values across multiple files, dedicated data models may be easier to read and maintain.
