## Explicitly document no operations

On occasions, some code might simply do nothing at all, these scenarios are usually referred to as [no operations (no-op)](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NOP_(code)>).
The reasons for the need to introduce a no-op may vary. For example, it could well be due to the need to align with an interface.

Leaving the no-operation without an explanatory comment may cause engineers to doubt whether
the code was left uncompleted intentionally or not. If there is a need for a no-op, document its existence.

  <TabItem label="Good ✅">
    ```dart
class BluetoothProcessor extends NetworkProcessor {
      @override
      void abort() {
          // Intentional no-op, an abort in Bluetooth has no resources to clean.
      }
}
```

  <TabItem label="Bad ❗️">
    ```dart
class BluetoothProcessor extends NetworkProcessor {
      @override
      void abort() {}
}
    ```
