## Explicitly document no operations

On occasions, some code might simply do nothing at all, these scenarios are usually referred to as [no operations (no-op)](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NOP_(code)>).
The reasons for the need to introduce a no-op may vary. For example, it could well be due to the need to align with an interface.

Leaving the no-operation without an explanatory comment may cause engineers to doubt whether
the code was left uncompleted intentionally or not. If there is a need for a no-op, document its existence.

      void abort() {
          // Intentional no-op, an abort in Bluetooth has no resources to clean.
      }
}
```

## Consider using asserts over inline comments

[Dart asserts](https://dart.dev/language/error-handling#assert) with messages enforce conditions during development and
provide immediate feedback if something goes wrong, while comments only document the code and don't prevent errors. 
Assertions help catch issues early, making debugging easier and more reliable.

```dart
(double?, double?) solveQuadraticEquation(double a, double b, double c) {
  assert(
    a != 0,
    'The coefficient of the square term must not be zero, otherwise is not a '
    'quadratic equation.',
  );

  final discriminant = b * b - 4 * a * c;
  return switch (discriminant) {
    final d when d > 0 => ((-b + sqrt(d)) / (2 * a), (-b - sqrt(d)) / (2 * a)),
    final d when d == 0 => (-b / (2 * a), null),
    _ => (null, null),
  };
}
